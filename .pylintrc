[TYPECHECK]

# List of members which are set dynamically and missed by pylint inference
# system, and so shouldn't trigger E1101 when accessed. Python regular
# expressions are accepted.
# In theory, cv2 could be handled by adding it to extension-pkg-allow-list.
# However, the maintainers of opencv-python repeatedly release versions of the
# package that cause pylint to trigger E1101 even when it's included in the
# allow list.

# List of classes names for which member attributes should not be checked
# (useful for classes with attributes dynamically set). This supports can work
# with qualified names.
